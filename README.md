## more fizzbuzz

This originally started with a concept of being able to add design code to any address then feeding back into a (version control system) VCS and then back into a cloud cache (memcache?) and then into a squid proxy and certificate root authority installed by domain administration as a secure "man in the middle" and back and forth with adware removed.

The big picture was thinking I could modify large parts of the entire public web with simple recognition scripts, and create custom designs for specific devices. E.g. all forums would look simplified on a nintendo Wii, or wikipedia would stop using the "m." prefix for mobile, all stores would look similar in their product listing. The biggest benefit would be removal of adware.

In the near term, I thought it would be funny to turn Google Sheets into a database backend, then regenarate HTML pages and serve with (content delivery network) CDN, and i suspect this is possible to with authenticated pre-generated pages through some sort of IAM. So all I wrote in node was a script to convert row-column cell structures and I apply my CSS after that. 

This code is very convoluded, but it was neat converting Markdown inside of cells into HTML and converting cells into HTML structure. I also spent too long trying to search for files, my Downloads folder was huge, and the Desktop folder had lots of screenshots. It would interesting to use GitHub's subdomain feature with an automatic Google Sheet creation script.

## TODO:

Try to generate some of this with ChatGPT. 
Copy some it from old Node.JS scripts. 
Combine existing column-row code with new with folder structure templates.
